# Airline-Tickets-Price-Analysis

📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes airline ticket prices to identify key factors influencing price variations. Using Python, we explore dataset features, perform data preprocessing, visualize trends, and build predictive models.

---------------------/
📊 Dataset Description

The dataset includes various attributes affecting airline ticket prices:

Airline: Name of the airline (categorical, 6 categories).

Flight: Flight code (categorical).

Source City: Origin city of the flight (6 unique values).

Departure Time: Categorical feature representing departure time bins.

Stops: Number of stops between source and destination (3 values).

Arrival Time: Categorical feature representing arrival time bins.

Destination City: Destination city of the flight (6 unique values).

Class: Travel class (Business/Economy).

Duration: Total flight duration in hours.

Days Left: Number of days left for departure.

Price: Ticket price (target variable).

📈 Analysis Performed:

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Distribution of ticket prices.

Correlation between different features and price.

* Data Preprocessing:

Handling missing values.

Encoding categorical features.

* Feature Engineering:

Creating new derived features from timestamps.
